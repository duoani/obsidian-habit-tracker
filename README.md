## Obsidian Habit Tracker Plugin

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) creates a simple month view for visualizing your punch records.

## How To
To show the view above, just create a code block and type:

~~~
```habitt
[month:2021-06]
(1,💮)(2,💮💮)(3)(5)(6)(7)(9, ⚽)(10, 🏄)(12)(18,💮💮💮)(22,🏆)(28,Pass) 
```
~~~

* `[month:YYYY-MM]`: Which month to display
* `(date_num, tag)`: The day (`date_num`) you want to punch in, with a `tag` in it. If `tag` is missing, such as `(12)`, a default tag `✔️` is given to that day.
* `[width: css_width]`: Restrict the Month-view table to `css_width`, such as `[width: 50%]`, `[width: 500px]`

### Rich Text
Some people like to insert rich text (e.g. links or images). Since v1.0.4, Habit Tracker plugin adds a new configuration `Enable HTML` to activate HTML parsing. **For some security reasons, this config is "off" as default.**

To insert Web URL:
~~~
```habitt
(1, <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>)
```
~~~

To insert other note in the Vault (Using Obsidian url):
~~~
```habitt
(1, <a href="obsidian://open?vault=my-notes&file=xxx">Google</a>)
```
~~~
Learn more about [Obsidian url](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Using+obsidian+URI).

To insert a image (from web):
~~~
```habitt
(1, <img src="https://www.xyz.com/img.jpg" />)
```
~~~
Since now, in Obsidian, we are not able to link the local image using `<img />` tag. See [Does ANY HTML work in Obsidian w/local files? - Resolved help - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/does-any-html-work-in-obsidian-w-local-files/8000).
